# OCR-applications
OSR applications as bellow:

1- Electricity, water and gas meter reading application using Real time cloud data
In this project, I used the Kotlin language issued in 2007 after programming a special application that connects and communicates with a cloud database (cloud data) on a virtual server.
Objective / Solve the problem of managing customer subscription vouchers in electricity, water and gas distribution companies, where the process of reading the various meters and calculating costs without the need to review the collection office for homes or work sites, where the responsible employee can manage data outside the limits of space and time.
This application will save a lot of money and time for companies, so what is used compared to the common methods.
The requirements to do this project for the user are only a mobile phone connected to the Internet. It is possible to develop this system using smart meters without the need for normal user interaction.

2- Monitoring and checking the data of passing cars in real time from a fixed or moving point
Because of the security and traffic conditions, the need for real-time applications has emerged to identify strange or suspicious cars at security points or in traffic departments for the purposes of tax collection and fines.
This project solves a large part of the problem, especially at government entrances, through which cars, their specifications and their owner can be identified within a second or less period. Where the databases of all cars are on the Cloud database, and any camera connected to a computer or mobile device is used to match the car numbers with the stored data in an instant in fractions of a second
